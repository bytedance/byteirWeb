## The ByteIR Framework: A Dive into Its Mechanics
The ByteIR Framework stands as an excellent example of compiler architecture, particularly in the realm of machine learning. Its mechanics are rooted in three key components: the Frontends, Compiler, and Runtime. Each of these elements plays a vital role in the framework's overall functionality, contributing to its efficiency and effectiveness.

<img src="/img/how_it_works.png"  width="90%">

Firstly, [Frontends](https://github.com/bytedance/byteir/tree/main/frontends) in ByteIR serve as the interface for developers, allowing them to interact with the framework using familiar programming languages and tools. They translate models written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), or [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/), into [Mhlo dialect](https://www.tensorflow.org/mlir/hlo_ops), which is the intermediate representation that ByteIR's Compiler can understand and optimize. This translation is a critical step in making ByteIR accessible to a wide range of developers, irrespective of their preferred programming language, and provides a unified type of input for the compiler.

The [Compiler](https://github.com/bytedance/byteir/tree/main/compiler) in ByteIR is a sophisticated engine that processes and optimizes machine learning models. It employs optimization passes to transform high-level code into an optimized form, making it more efficient for execution. This optimization is crucial for performance-critical applications, ensuring that models run swiftly and effectively. For example, we provide CAT dialect to lower into [AITemplate](https://github.com/facebookincubator/AITemplate) backend for Nvidia GPU. What's more, we provide a series of Linalg Extensions. We not only implement more ops for the original Linalg dialect, but also provide enhanced transformations that are useful for fusion, tiling, etc.

The [Runtime](https://github.com/bytedance/byteir/tree/main/runtime) component of ByteIR is equally essential. It acts as the execution environment for the optimized models, managing resources and handling interactions with the underlying hardware. This includes memory allocation management, a collection of operation runtime implementations, and a work queue for execution. The Runtime ensures that the optimized code produced by the Compiler is executed seamlessly, providing a robust platform for running complex machine learning models.

In essence, the ByteIR Framework's mechanics are a symphony of well-orchestrated components, each contributing its unique functionality. The Compiler's optimization capabilities, coupled with the Runtime's efficient execution environment and the Frontends' user-friendly interfaces, make ByteIR a powerful tool in the realm of machine learning model compilation. The framework's use of MLIR dialects and ByRE interfaces exemplifies its innovative approach to facilitating smooth and efficient communication across its various components.

## ByteIR and Compatibility: Meeting MLIR Dialects

The seamless interaction between these components is a cornerstone of ByteIR's design. Communication within the framework is facilitated through MLIR dialects including [Mhlo](https://www.tensorflow.org/mlir/hlo_ops), [Linalg](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/Linalg/), [ByRE](https://github.com/bytedance/byteir/tree/main/compiler/lib/Dialect/Byre), [CAT](https://github.com/bytedance/byteir/tree/main/compiler/lib/Dialect/Cat), etc. MLIR dialects provide a flexible way to represent different levels of abstraction in the code, allowing the Compiler to understand and optimize various parts of the model effectively. We also have several interface dialects, on the other hand, to ensure seamless communication between the Compiler and Runtime, enabling efficient execution of optimized models. MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) dialects play a crucial role in enhancing the compatibility of the ByteIR Framework across various levels of abstraction and computational paradigms. This is achieved through several key mechanisms:

1. Layered Abstraction: MLIR dialects enable ByteIR to operate at multiple levels of abstraction. This means that the framework can efficiently handle everything from high-level algorithmic descriptions to low-level hardware-specific optimizations. By providing these multiple layers, MLIR dialects ensure that ByteIR remains compatible with a wide range of machine learning models and hardware architectures.

2. Modular Design: The dialects in MLIR are inherently modular. This modularity allows ByteIR to integrate new functionalities or support for new hardware without overhauling the entire system. As new computational technologies emerge, ByteIR can adapt by simply adding new dialects, ensuring ongoing compatibility with the evolving landscape of machine learning and computing.

3. Cross-Platform Optimization: The MLIR dialects facilitate cross-platform optimizations by allowing ByteIR to understand and transform code in a way that is agnostic to the underlying hardware. This universality means that optimizations are not just limited to a specific type of device or architecture, but can be applied broadly, enhancing ByteIR's compatibility with a diverse range of computing environments.

4. Interoperability with Other Frameworks: By utilizing MLIR, ByteIR can interoperate with other frameworks and tools that also support MLIR. This interoperability is key for compatibility in a heterogeneous computing environment where different tools and frameworks are often used in conjunction. The ability to integrate smoothly with other systems ensures that ByteIR can be a versatile component in a broader machine learning ecosystem.

5. Customization and Extension: MLIR dialects allow for customization and extension according to specific needs. Developers can create custom dialects that cater to unique aspects of their models or target specific hardware optimizations. This flexibility ensures that ByteIR remains compatible with a wide array of specialized requirements, further broadening its applicability.

## ByteIR Success Stories: Testimonials from the Open Source World

ByteIR is already making a substantial impact in the field of model compilation. Its success stories, highlighted through specific examples and case studies, demonstrate the significant changes and advancements it has contributed to the field.

### LLM compilation with ByteIR

Here we give a case study of how we compile LLMs (Large Language Models) with ByteIR. The efficiency of training LLMs has become more and more important. Model compilation plays an important role in AI acceleration. However, it's not trivial to adopt model compilation to LLMs, considering the graph size and complexity. With ByteIR, here is our high-level compilation workflow:
- Step 1: Capture PyTorch FX graphs through torch dynamo (aka torch.compile)
- Step 2: Preprocess FX graphs, and convert FX graphs into `mhlo` through ByteIR TorchFrontend pipelines.
- Step 3: The ByteIR compiler optimizes graphs and chooses different codegen paths (LLVM GPU codegen, custom runtime kernels, AITemplate codegen, etc.) for subgraphs.
- Step 4: The ByteIR runtime processes the compiler's outputs, launches kernel executions, and then delivers the results back to the PyTorch dynamo.

<img src="/img/blog/advancements/llm_pipeline.png" width="95%">

There are several codegen paths. For GPU Codegen, LLVM PTX codegen lowers GPU dialect into [LLVM](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/LLVM/)/[NVVM](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/NVVMDialect/) dialect, and then translates it to PTX using LLVM PTX backend. Then the CUDA emitter directly translates GPU dialect to CUDA C source code. AITemplate is a Python framework which renders neural networks into high performance CUDA code(based on [CUTLASS](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cutlass-linear-algebra-cuda/)). CUTLASS is NVIDIA's collection of CUDA C++ template abstractions for implementing high-performance matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) and related computations within CUDA. For AITemplate Integration, we adopt mhlo-to-CAT passes where we would convert mhlo ops to CAT ops (one CAT op corresponds to one AIT op). Flash attention is a fast and memory efficient exact implementation of attention. For flash-attention-2 integration, we match attention FX patterns, rewrite them to `torch.ops.aten.scaled_dot_product_attention`, and then rewrite it to `byteir.flash_attn_fwd/bwd` custom ops.

<img src="/img/blog/advancements/comparison.png"  width="90%">

Test results show that the performance of models compiled with ByteIR outperforms that of [Inductor](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/torchinductor-a-pytorch-native-compiler-with-define-by-run-ir-and-symbolic-shapes/747) over a wide range of LLMs. This empirically showcases performance optimization by ByteIR compiler and runtime. For end users, the benefits are as follows:

1. Integration of Different Frameworks: ByteIR's ability to incorporate different frameworks is a substantial advantage. This integration allows developers to utilize the strengths of various frameworks within a single environment. It simplifies the development process, especially in complex projects that may require features from multiple frameworks. Currently, we incorporate models from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNX. It can be expanded to any framework as long as we implement a frontend to lower the framework into Mhlo dialect.

2. Customizable Optimizations with Pass Mechanism: The pass mechanism in ByteIR enables customizable optimizations. This means developers can tailor the optimization process to the specific needs of their project. It allows for more efficient code execution and can significantly improve performance, especially in resource-intensive applications. There are already a variety of passes for different tasks and models.

3. Support for Different Devices: ByteIR's compatibility with different devices broadens its applicability. This feature is particularly valuable in the current tech landscape where software needs to run across a variety of hardware platforms, from desktops and servers to mobile devices and embedded systems. This flexibility ensures that applications developed with ByteIR can reach a wider audience and are more adaptable to future technological changes. One typical example is [ByteMLPerf](https://bytemlperf.ai/), which relies on ByteIR to provide an AI Accelerator Benchmark that evaluates a wide array of AI Accelerators.

In summary, ByteIR's success stories in the open-source world highlight its significant contributions and effectiveness in various domains.
