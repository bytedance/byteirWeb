Adopting an open source compiler infrastructure into an existing production ML compiler is challenging and tricky. In this talk, Li-wen Chang from ByteIR shared the experience of how we adopted MLIR and reformed our existing production ML compiler, and discussed about what lessons we have learnt and benefits we have gained. Our compiler involves optimizations in multiple levels across services, graphs, and loops, in order to automatically and seamlessly deploy models. In this talk, he also covered optimization of each and took a deep dive into their technical needs and challenges, and our corresponding solutions. You could check more about our Linalg Dialect optimization at our poster:
