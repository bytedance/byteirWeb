<p class="lead" style="font-size: 30px; margin-bottom: 60px;">End-to-end model compilation solution.
</p>

<p class="home-description" style="min-height: 200px;">
  ByteIR provides an end-to-end model compilation solution, including frontends, compiler, and runtime.
  Although all ByteIR components (frontends/compiler/runtime) are together to provide an end-to-end solution and all under the same umbrella, 
  each component is built in a modular way and can perform independently.
